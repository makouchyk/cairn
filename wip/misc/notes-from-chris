### From Chris:
INTENT - What are you trying to do?  
LEVERAGE - What makes it possible? If outcome and cost are assured, go to Impact.  
STAKES - What's at risk? If thereâ€™s no risk, go straight to Impact.  
ROLL - Make a Save or a Luck Roll.  
IMPACT - Show the consequences of their action, honouring the established Stakes, and move things forward.  
(based off the procedure I wrote for Ask the Stars but it's a good fit for ITO too)  
so jumping over the pit is the classic:  
INTENT: Pretty straightforward, get to the other side.  
LEVERAGE: Is it an easy enough jump? Just do it. Too far? Come up with a better plan. Risky? Let's keep going.  
STAKES: So seems like "fall down the pit" is the obvious stake here, but take this moment to talk about whether it's an "ow my ankle" pit or an "impaled on spikes" pit. You sure you still want to put this down to a DEX Save instead of just finding a safe way over? (for our example let's say they're in a rush and have to leap)  
ROLL - DEX Save or fall down into the pit  
IMPACT - Damage for anybody going into the pit, based on the stakes we set earlier establishing the nature of the pit
