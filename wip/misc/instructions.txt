### Instructions for Converting Markdown to JSON:

The following are detailed instructions for converting a given Markdown text into a JSON structure, focusing specifically on the extraction of titles, descriptions, names, starting gear, tables, and the assembly of the "background_items" structure. I will paste a single markdown file at a time, and you will convert it to JSON.

1. **Title and Image Extraction**:
   - Identify the title of the document. It's usually the first line and starts with a hash symbol (#). Record the text following this symbol as the title.
   - For the "image" key, set the value as [background name].png (lowercase).

2. **Description Extraction**:
   - Find the description of the character or role. It's typically located right after the title and is enclosed within angle brackets (>). Copy the text inside these brackets as the description.

3. **Names Extraction**:
   - Search for a line that starts with two hash symbols (##) followed by "Names". The names are listed below this line, separated by commas. Split this list at each comma to capture individual names.

4. **Starting Gear Extraction**:
   - Locate the section beginning with "## Starting Gear". Each gear item is listed on a new line starting with a dash (-). Record the item's name as it appears, including any specifications or measurements (e.g., "Chains (10ft)"). Ensure that the item's name starts with a capital letter.

5. **Background Items Extraction**:
   - Extract the items mentioned in the text, including the starting gear and those in tables. For each item:
     - The text immediately following the dash or enclosed in double asterisks (**) is the item's name. Include measurements or specifications as part of the item's name if mentioned (e.g., "Chains (10ft)").
     - If there's text in parentheses (()), it contains the item's details.
       - **Important**: Only include the following words as tags: "bulky", "petty", "blast", "Armor", and die notations (e.g., "d4", "d6", "d8", "d10", "d12", "d6+d6"). Treat "1 Armor", "2 Armor", "3 Armor", "+1 Armor", etc., as tags. Words like "enhanced" and "impaired" should not be included as tags. Do not create new tags or include any other words or phrases as tags, regardless of their contextual significance.
       - Tags are keywords that directly impact the gameplay mechanics of the item. If in doubt, refer to the provided list and include only those specified.
     - Look for numbers followed by the word "uses" or "charges" (e.g., "6 uses", "2 charges"), indicating the maximum uses for the item. Include the tag "uses" in the "tags" array and specify the total number of uses in the "max_uses" field. If the item has unlimited uses or charges, set "max_uses" to `null`. If an item is listed with "uses" or "charges" but without a specific number, include the tag "uses" and set "max_uses" to `null`.
   - If an item description includes a method for recharging, add this information to the "description" field of the item.

6. **Tables Extraction**:
   - Identify sections starting with "##", which indicate a new table. The text following "##" is the table's question.
   - Each table consists of options formatted as "- Description: ...".
     - The "Description" should include the full text of the table result.
     - The "Description" might also include items, clearly listed within the text. Separate these items from the rest of the description.
     - If the description contains text in parentheses, these are the item's details:
       - Search for the specific keywords and patterns as mentioned earlier that are considered tags.
       - Look for numbers followed by "uses" or "charges" for maximum uses.
     - Record any gold found in the description and note the amount.
   - Record the table question and options in a structured format, including description, items, and gold.
   - **Ensure that all items listed in the options of the tables are captured and included in the JSON structure under the appropriate table.**

7. **Structure Assembly**:
   - Create a JSON structure with the following keys:
     - "background": The recorded title.
     - "image": The file name constructed from the background name.
     - "background_description": The recorded description.
     - "names": The list of recorded names.
     - "background_items": A dictionary where each key is an item name, and the value is another dictionary with keys "tags", "max_uses", and "description". Fill in the details for each item based on the extracted tags and maximum uses. Leave "description" as an empty string unless a

 method for recharging is specified.
     - "starting_gear": A list of the starting gear items.
     - "table1", "table2", etc.: A structured representation of the tables, including the question and options.
     - Do not include the roll number or any dice notation.
     - Do not add comments (e.g. "//").
     - Remove any markdown notations for bold and italic from the entire JSON structure.

8. **Review and Adjustments**:
   - Carefully review the JSON structure to ensure that it accurately reflects the information in the Markdown text. Pay particular attention to the "background_items" to ensure that tags and maximum uses are correctly captured.
   - Ensure that item names are recorded exactly as they appear, including any specifications or measurements.
   - Verify that only the specified words are included as tags and avoid adding any unlisted words or phrases.

9. **Verification of Tables**:
   - After constructing the JSON, specifically verify that all items listed within the tables' options have been captured.
   - Cross-check the "table1", "table2", etc., structures against the original Markdown to confirm that no items, descriptions, or gold values have been missed.
   - If any items are found to be missing or incorrect, revise the JSON structure to include them accurately.

These instructions are intended to guide you through the process of accurately converting Markdown text into a structured JSON format, paying close attention to the specific requirements for each section. The goal is to ensure the resulting JSON is a faithful representation of the original Markdown content, allowing for effective use in applications or games that will utilize the data.
