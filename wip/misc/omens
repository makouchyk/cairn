## Misc
**The Wooded Dead**, a group of benign Forest Liches. After trespassing on a sacred grove, they demand you plant a grove of rare (and expensive) **Corpsewood** trees, whose saplings grow wherever the dead rest in great numbers. Until your debt is paid, travelling through **The Woods** is slower, and forest critters shy away from you.  

You stumbled upon a **dormant** mechanical creature buried in a field close to home. Its chest houses a gear you've been keeping safe. The gear is cold to the touch and occasionally ticks like a clock.         

Absolutely, here are ten more omens:

| **33**  | A strange monolith has appeared in the center of the village overnight. It stands taller than any building, made from an unidentifiable, black stone.

| **36**  | The village's well-known wise elder has been spotted sleepwalking, mumbling of an impending doom.

| **39**  | Each morning, villagers awaken to find that their shadows are misshapen or behaving oddly. At noon, some cast long shadows as if it were dusk, others cast multiple shadows, and some cast none at all.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **40**  | A comet has appeared in the sky, visible even during the day. Some believe it to be a sign of great change or upheaval to come, while others see it as a beacon leading something or someone to the village.                                                                                                                              |
