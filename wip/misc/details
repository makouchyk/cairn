d6	Hazard

2	Toxic mist


A field of razor-sharp blades that move with the wind
A towering wall of water that crashes down every hour
A cloud of toxic gas that randomly shifts location
A section of the land that is always on fire
A region where the air is so thin that it is difficult to breathe
A dense, impenetrable fog that causes hallucinations
A series of pits filled with venomous snakes
A network of underground tunnels that are prone to cave-ins
A lake that is infused with a powerful acid
A forest of carnivorous trees that lure prey with hypnotic sounds
A mountain that constantly erupts with fiery lava
A desert where sandstorms are a daily occurrence
