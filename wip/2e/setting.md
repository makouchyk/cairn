### Summary
- A setting has a **Theme**, **Terrain**, **Details**, and **Factions**. 
- See [this page](/wip/2e/example-setting) for an example setting, and generate (most) of the setting automatically with [this](https://perchance.org/cairn-setting-generator).
- Distance is measured in [**Watches**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot.

## Theme
To help create your setting's theme, answer the following questions:
 - How does magic work?
 - What level of technology do the denizens have?
 - How does religion function? Do gods walk the lands, and do the people know it?
 - Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their position with respect to those in power?
 - What species & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
 - What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting? 

## Provinces
- A **Province** is a single, traversable landscape roughly defined by divisible terrain (mountain ranges, rivers, oceans). 
- A **Domain** is one or more adjacent **Provinces** defined by the same ruler(s). 
- Each **Province** has a **Heart**: a settlement (of any size) that reflects the history, **Factions**, and peoples of the land.

### Scale
- **Small Province**: A **Heart** no more than _four_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**, and up to 3 **Factions**.  
- **Medium Province**: A **Heart** no more than _eight_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**, and up to 6 **Factions**.
- **Large Province**: A **Heart** no more than _sixteen_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**, and up to 9 **Factions**.

### Creating a Province
1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a dot to signify the **Heart** of the **Province**. 
2. Create three more dots in a triangle with the **Heart** in the rough center. Each of these dots represents an additional **Detail** on the map. 
3. Connect two of the dots to the **Heart**, using solid lines to represent roads, dotted lines for trails, double solid lines for rivers, and double dotted lines for tunnels. 
4. Connect the remaining dot to one of these paths, crossing it and continuing for a distance. 
5. Repeat step **2**, orienting the triangle of dots in a different way than before. 
6. Connect two of the new dots to _any_ path, but do not connect the final dot to anything! This is the **Frontier**.
7. Create a new dot wherever paths cross, and wherever a new path ends. 
8. Number the dots, starting from the **Heart** and expanding outwards. The **Heart** is always **1**, and the **Frontier** is always the terminal number.

#### Tips
- You can increase the **Province Scale** by doubling the size of the triangle in step **5**, then adding dots halfway between two points on any line (roads, trails, rivers, etc.).
- You can use other shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, etc.) to create dots instead. You can even mix & match!
- You can repeat this process for any adjacent **Provinces**, connecting them by road, river, or range. 

### Adding Terrain
1. Roll on the [Terrain](#terrain) table below for each numbered dot, starting with the **Heart**. 
2. Terrain modifiers are based on the [Terrain Difficulty](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#terrain-difficulty) rules. **E** = _Easy_, **T** = _Tough_, **P** = _Perilous_.
3. Draw or indicate the terrain for each dot on the map.

#### Terrain

|        |                                                       |

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **d12** |                                                                                                                    |
| **1**   | The clouds are shaped like faces. They appear to be laughing.                                                      |
| **2**   | Roaming, coughing, dust clouds that smell of cinnamon.                                                             |
| **3**   | Days are erratic. The Sun goes backwards for a time, then jumps forward as night rapidly sets.                     |
| **4**   | Lakes and streams dry up in minutes, filling storm clouds that drench the landscape.                               |
| **5**   | Rainbows lack most of their colors, and occasionally flicker. Raindrops fall in various colors. Do not taste them. |
| **6**   | Distant chimes instead of thunder. A smoky, sweet wind of no apparent origin blows in from the West.              |
| **7**   | Fog there fills the belly (no need for rations). Tomorrow, vomiting.                                               |
| **8**   | The winds carry whispers of voices. Some say they tell hints of the future.                                        |
| **9**   | Shadows disappear at random. Animals are reluctant to enter.                                                       |
| **10**  | Flashes of movement in the periphery that always amount to nothing. Travelers return without gaps in their memories.      |
| **11**  | The air is thicker than usual, and breathing is difficult. Drinking water seems to help.                           |
| **12**  | Periodic rains of small aquatic creatures (tadpoles, frogs, small fish). No one knows where they come from.        |

## Details
- Each dot on the map is one **Detail**. **Details** act as [**Points**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) according to the [**Wilderness Exploration**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration) rules. Keep in mind how many **Watches** it might take to travel to each **Detail**. 
- The **Heart** of a **Province** is always a settlement. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should always have a significant history. 
- Assume there are small villages scattered around larger settlements. These do not need to be represented by dots or **Details**!   

### Adding Details
1. Roll on the [Settlements](#settlements) and [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) tables to generate the **Heart** of the **Province**.
2. Generate features for each remaining dot _except_ the **Frontier** by first rolling on the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table.
3. For any additional Settlements rolled, roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table as well.
4. Generate features for the **Frontier** by rolling _only_ the [Special](#special) table.

> If some of the results below seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn it into a question: _Why_ is there **hazardous** terrain so close to a settlement? Perhaps there were mines there once, long abandoned. Rumors as to their true treasure - and dangers - abound! That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

### Detail Names
- Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. The residents then add a noun or adjective: _Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Rotting Gardens_, etc.
- Important places (like cities) should have important names, like those of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events: _The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine_, etc.
- Wild and dangerous places are named after their obvious hazards: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: _Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path_, etc. 

#### Generating Names
- Starting with the **Heart**, roll on the [Detail Names Formula](#detail-names-formula) table to name each **Detail** on the map. 
- Roll on the [Adjectives](#adjectives) and [Nouns](#nouns) table where appropriate, and consult the [Terrain Synonyms](#terrain-synonyms) table for inspiration. 
- Refer to the [Example Names](#example-names) for a model of each table result. [**Proper Nouns**] can be added to or even replace parts of a name, e.g. **Bruna's Ugly Gulch**. 

| To roll **1d100**, roll **2d10**, using one die for the tens place, and one die for the ones place.

## Factions
- For complete rules, see [here](/wip/2e/factions).
- Factions can vary in size. Some may compete over a single **Detail**, while others may control one or more **Details**, an entire **Province**, or even a **Domain**. 
- The setting map should reflect the impact of **Factions** as they work on completing their **Agendas** and acquiring more **Advantages** (see [Factions](/wip/2e/factions) for more information).

> Less is more when it comes to creating your initial Factions.  A few **Factions** that have interests and a presence in multiple **Details** within your Setting are easier to manage than a dozen smaller **Factions** of limited scope.  You can always add more if, in the process of fleshing out a **Detail**, it makes sense to do so.

### Initial Faction Creation
1. First, decide how many **Factions** you would like to create, or refer to the **Province** [Scale](#scale). 
 Generally it is a good idea to have at least one **Faction** in each **Settlement**, as well as at least one headquartered out of a **Lair** or **Ruin**.
2. Roll on the [**Faction Types**](#faction-types) table to determine the nature of each **Faction**.
3. Consider the **Details** and **Terrain** you've developed. Place each **Faction** at a **Detail** that makes sense for its **Faction Type**.
4. Roll on the [**Faction Names**](#faction-names) for each **Faction** you have created.

#### Faction Types
- Every **Faction** can generally be placed in one of the following broad categories.  
- A **Faction Type** at odds with your existing Setting isn't necessarily a problem.
- Some **Factions** are outsiders within a **Province**. 

|        | **Faction Type**  | **Example Factions**                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | **Academic**      | _Royal Topographer's Society_. An upstart cartographer's guild, preparing to map the **Far Reaches**. Many have tried, but none have returned. |
| **2**  | **Arcane**        | _The Syndak_. A league of wizards in search of an ancient power. They cannot allow it to fall into the wrong hands.                            |
| **3**  | **Commoners**     | _Unite or Perish_. Together, they are strong. Together they can move mountains. But who do they really serve?                                  |
| **4**  | **Criminal**      | _Missing Fingers_. An uneasy alliance of ruffians, thieves, and killers. Their boss is the most terrifying of them all.                        |
| **5**  | **Government**    | _The Bloc_. Politicians, bureaucrats, tax collectors: they are everywhere. Who are they helping, besides themselves?                           |
| **6**  | **Industrial**    | _The Iron Pantheon_. Workers, united by a charismatic and troubled leader. Fighting for a better life.                                         |
| **7**  | **Mercantile**    | _Earnest Buyer's Club_. A cartel of beaming merchants, vendors, and trade experts. Followers of none, save for the almighty coin.              |
| **8**  | **Military**      | _Azure Guard_. Disgraced officers, relying on their only remaining assets: a soldier's loyalty. It might be enough.                            |
| **9**  | **Noble**         | _Lichthammer_. A family built on deft politicking. Their house is in debt to a dangerous group, and they could lose everything.                |
| **10** | **Religious**     | _His Noble Justice._ Stewards of sacred artifacts, guided by the divine to reclaim their most holy of objects.                                 |
| **11** | **Revolutionary** | _Light Rising_. The body politic is diseased beyond redemption. Plenty are ready to die for the cause, but only one is fit to lead them.       |
| **12** | **Syndicate**     | _Praxis._ A secret society, its machinations shrouded in mystery. But its goal is all too clear: a new world order.                            |

### Non-random Province Names
Consider the following when determining the **Province** name:
- What are the key geographic features of the region? 
- What major events (war, famine, discoveries) occurred here in the past? Who were the major players?
- What sort of factions have historically dominated this place?
- A name may also include a reference to the region's relative position to the seat of power: _The Northeast Redoubt_, _Western Ranges_, etc.
- The name (first, or family) of a "discoverer", conqueror or colonizer often sticks around long after their death.

## Conclusion
Congratulations, your **Province** is complete! You can now "drill down" into various locations (starting with the **Heart**) and build out each **Detail** on your own favorite tables. Keep the following thoughts in mind as you go:
- How might the interactions between the **Factions** interact with the landscape, its features, and one another? How will this change as the **Factions** succeed (or fail) at their goals? 
Consider which **Factions** may be allied, and which opposed? Keep in mind the region's history, what a **Faction** might have that others would want, and what someone would do to _get_ them. 
- Consider the history of the region's original "discoverers", the locals they may have supplanted, and where both groups are today. 
- When building out the next **Province**, keep in mind how it would have interacted historically with this **Province**, and what might happen between them in the future.

> If you find anything _amiss_ or **wrong** feel free to change it, or add your own **Details**. Remember, it's _your_ setting.
