# Making Monsters


## Monster "Rules"

- If an action can be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Attack and interacts with HP.
- If an action cannot be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Ability.
- If an Ability only affects a single PC it should generally have an immediate effect with no chance to Save in that round (possibly not at all).
- If an Ability is capable of affecting a group of PCs it should generally call for an immediate Save.
- Adjust based on what is fun and interesting.
